This code snippet demonstrates a potential issue in PHP related to using the `unset()` function with array references.  When you unset an element from an array using a reference, it only removes the element from that specific reference, not from the original array. This can lead to unexpected behavior and hard-to-track bugs. 
```php
<?php
$myArray = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
$myArrayRef = &$myArray;
unset($myArrayRef[0]);
print_r($myArray); // Output: Array ( [1] => 2 [2] => 3 [3] => 4 [4] => 5 )
unset($myArray[1]);
print_r($myArrayRef); //Output: Array ( [2] => 3 [3] => 4 [4] => 5 )
?>
```
