# PHP Unset() with Array References: Unexpected Behavior

This repository demonstrates a subtle but potentially problematic behavior in PHP when using the `unset()` function with array references.  The issue stems from the fact that `unset()` operates on the specific reference, rather than modifying the original array directly.  This can lead to inconsistent results and make debugging more challenging.

## The Problem

The `unset()` function, when applied to an array element referenced through a reference variable, only removes the element from that specific reference. The original array remains unchanged unless you use `unset()` on it directly.

## Reproduction

The `bug.php` file contains code that illustrates this issue. Run the script to observe how `unset()` affects the original array and its reference differently.

## Solution

The `bugSolution.php` file offers a potential solution, but this case is often better handled by careful planning and code design. Be mindful of your reference usages and avoid unexpected behavior.
